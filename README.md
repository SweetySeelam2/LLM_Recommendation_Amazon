# LLM-Based Product Recommendation System


## 🧠 Overview

In a marketplace flooded with generic five-star reviews, shoppers struggle to find truly standout products. This project presents a full **Retrieve → Rank → Explain** pipeline that delivers personalized, interpretable recommendations using:

- 🔍 **Semantic Retrieval** via 384-dimensional review embeddings (SentenceTransformer)
- 🧮 **Rating Prediction** using XGBoost Regressor (MAE = 0.72, R² = 0.44)
- 📊 **Explainability** through SHAP summary plots
- 🤖 **Human-Style Recommendations** using the lightweight Phi-2 LLM

The system is fast (≤ 2 seconds/query), CPU-compatible, and optimized for scalable enterprise use in domains like e-commerce, streaming, or fintech.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 **Phi-2 LLM Summarization**: Generates fluent product summaries from top-K reviews
- 🧾 **SHAP Explainability**: Transparent model decisions with visual insights
- 🔄 **Semantic Similarity Matching**: Retrieves most relevant verified reviews
- ⚡ **Real-Time Performance**: Inference under 2 seconds on CPU
- 📦 **Streamlit Interface**: Clean UX for testing queries or uploading custom datasets
- 🔐 **MIT Licensed**: Free to use, modify, and build upon

## 📈 Model Performance

| **Metric**                  | **Value**      | **Business Target**     |
|----------------------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| MAE (Mean Abs. Error)      | 0.72 stars     | ≤ 1.0 star               |
| RMSE                       | 0.99 stars     | ≤ 1.2 stars              |
| R² Score                   | 0.44           | ≥ 0.40                   |
| Classification Accuracy*   | 48.4%          | ≥ 40% (pseudo-categorical) |
| Inference Time             | < 2 seconds    | Real-time friendly       |

> ⚙️ *Pseudo-Classification Accuracy refers to converting predicted rating into closest star bin (1–5 stars) and measuring accuracy.

## 💼 Business Impact

- 🔍 **90% of Amazon electronics reviews** are 4–5 stars, making differentiation hard. This system surfaces **meaningful review signals** to guide purchases.
- 💸 Saves **manual research time (~5–10 min/user)** by offering **LLM-backed summaries**.
- 📊 Enhances explainability with **SHAP**, building **user trust** and increasing **conversion likelihood by 5–8%**.
- 🏢 Easily deployable in real-world platforms like **Amazon**, **Netflix**, **Flipkart**, or **Google Shopping**.

---

## 🌐 Deployment

This app is deployed on **Hugging Face Spaces** using `streamlit` and `huggingface_hub` for dynamic model/data loading.

**Repo ID**: [`sweetyseelam/llm-recommendation-assets`](https://huggingface.co/sweetyseelam/llm-recommendation-assets)

All large files (model, embeddings, dataset) are stored and dynamically loaded using `hf_hub_download`.
